# In addition to these values, in order for HTTP requests to work,
# you need to obtain API keys for the FRC and TBA APIs. Place them in
# a .env file in the root of this project (i.e. the one main.py is in),
# with the keys FRC_AUTH, TBA_AUTH and NEXUS_AUTH respectively.

# A sample .env file would be as follows:

# FRC_AUTH=username:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
# TBA_AUTH=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# NEXUS_AUTH=xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# You should, of course, replace these with your actual API keys.

# Note that the key you get from the FRC API is not in its correct format:
# you need to add your username to the beginning, and seperate your username
# from the key with a colon ":". It should look something like in the
# example above.
