The Hub75 connectors that come with the panels have colour-coded wires:
-	The brown wire on one end (not the one somewhere in the middle) corresponds to pin 1 (R1).
-	The red wire next to it corresponds to pin 2 (G1)
-	The orange wire next to it is B1, and so on.
-	Only one GND needs to be connected, you can pick whichever wire you like most and connect it to whichever ground pin you like the most.

That being said, these are the connections to the Pi:

All pins except gpio-1 through gpio-8 are used by the LED panels.

gpio-1 through gpio-8 are hooked up directly to the keypad; whilst any GPIO pins can technically be used, these eight are the most convenient.

gpio-1..4 are, by default, the four row lines (top to bottom);
similarly, gpio-5..8 are the four column lines (left to right).
