NOTE: This project is highly specific, and is unlikely to be of use to many people.

It's also not written very well; this is a Python project to get data from an API and asynchronously update a display connected to a Raspberry Pi -- written by someone who's not sure how to do any of those things.

In addition to the dependencies in `requirements.txt`, you also need https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix -- this is, after all, designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi.

You also need API keys for the FRC Events API and The Blue Alliance, which can be acquired at their specific websites. See the bottom of `configuration/constants.yaml` for details.
